Further Potential Enhancements (Beyond this initial version):

    Advanced Invoice Generation: PDF export for invoices.
    Reporting: Summaries of expenses, income, etc.
    User Roles & Permissions: If multiple users need to access the system.
    Notifications: For overdue invoices or other important events.
    File Attachments: For invoices, expense receipts, etc.
    Full-text Search: For projects, invoices, etc.
    More Detailed Material Indent Workflow: Tracking indent status changes more explicitly.
    Error Handling and UI Feedback: More granular error messages and loading states.
    Automated Deletion of Subcollections: When a project is deleted, its associated invoices, expenses, and contacts should also be deleted (this requires more complex Firestore logic).
